# Titanweave Build Status

K14.C5 is source-integrated from the frozen, QEMU-qualified K14.C4 baseline. All inherited K1-K14.C4 source gates and the new K14.C5 AMD-Vi page-table gate pass in the packaging environment. Userspace assembly builds successfully here. The packaging environment does not contain Cargo/Rust, so full Rust/QEMU runtime qualification must be performed on Fedora before C5 is frozen. Physical Radeon bus mastering, MMIO writes, firmware upload and command submission remain fenced.

K14.C22: qualified/frozen. Bounded reversible GFX12 SCRATCH_REG0 mutation and exact restoration passed Fedora/QEMU qualification; physical Radeon execution remains a separate bare-metal proof.

K14.C23: qualified/frozen. Fedora/QEMU passed the post-restore persistence and dual-probe stability safe-defer path with automatic intentional-HALT termination.

K14.C24: qualified/frozen from frozen qualified K14.C23. Fedora/QEMU runtime qualification passed the deterministic reversible four-bit SCRATCH_REG0 pattern/readback/restore gate with automatic intentional-HALT termination. Physical Radeon execution remains a separate bare-metal proof.

K14.C25: source-integrated from frozen qualified K14.C24; QEMU qualification pending. Adds two distinct deterministic reversible four-bit SCRATCH_REG0 pattern/readback/restore cycles with an inter-cycle persistence gate on the same exact target. No additional Radeon register authority is opened.
